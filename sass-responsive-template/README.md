# SASS responsive template

Structured SASS template project for responsive design from scratch (without bootstrap-like framework).

- 3 rupture points
- utilities class and mixin to produce readable code and to focus on CSS coding
- output as optimized stylesheets (one file per target device) or all-in-one (with @media in the CSS file)
